Animal Cruelty Data Analysis Using Power BI

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing animal cruelty data to identify patterns, trends, and key insights. The dataset includes various attributes related to reported cases, such as location, type of cruelty, affected species, and legal actions taken. The objective of this analysis is to provide a clear and data-driven understanding of the prevalence of animal cruelty, helping stakeholders such as policymakers, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies take informed actions. The dashboard includes interactive visuals, including bar charts, heatmaps, and trend lines, allowing users to explore incident distribution by region, severity, and frequency over time. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the total number of cases, most affected species, and conviction rates help highlight critical findings. By leveraging Power BIâ€™s capabilities, this project aims to drive awareness and support data-driven decision-making in the fight against animal cruelty.
